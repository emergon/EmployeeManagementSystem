# Employee Management System

Welcome to the Employee Management System project! This repository contains two separate exercises:

1. [List Assignment](List-Assignment.md)
2. [Set Assignment](Set-Assignment.md)

## List Assignment

The **List Assignment** exercise focuses on implementing an Employee Management System using `ArrayList` to store employee data. It involves creating classes to represent employees and building functionalities to add, remove, display, and search employee information. Additionally, there are optional challenges to implement error handling and sorting employees based on salary.

Please see the [List Assignment](List-Assignment.md) file for detailed instructions and the exercise tasks.

## Set Assignment

The **Set Assignment** exercise revolves around extending the Employee Management System to include projects for each employee. Projects are stored in a `HashSet`, and functionalities for sorting projects based on due date and priority are added using `TreeSet`.

To explore this exercise further, refer to the [Set Assignment](Set-Assignment.md) file.
