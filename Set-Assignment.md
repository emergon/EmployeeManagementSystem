# Employee Management System - Sets Implementation

## Description:
In this exercise, you are tasked with enhancing the Employee Management System by adding functionality to manage projects for each employee using sets - `HashSet` and `TreeSet`. Each employee can have multiple projects associated with them, and each project will have a name, due date, and priority.

## Instructions:

1. Employee Class:
Update the `Employee` class:
   - Add a `HashSet` attribute to store and remove projects for each employee.

2. Project Class:
Create the `Project` class with attributes:
   - Name (String)
   - Due Date (LocalDate)
   - Priority (Enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)

3. ManagementSystem Class:
Update the `ManagementSystem` class to provide the following functionality:
   - Display the projects of a specified employee.
   - Find the employee that has a specified project.
   - Sort and display all the projects by due date or priority.

Remember to use object-oriented principles, proper data structures, and sets functionality to complete the exercise. This exercise will demonstrate the usage of `HashSet` and `TreeSet` in managing projects for employees.
